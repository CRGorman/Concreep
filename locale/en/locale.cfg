[mod-setting-description]
concreep range=Range that roboports will automatically place concreep as a percentage of roboport construction range. (0-100, Default 100)
concreep construction factor=Divisor of available construction robots to use for placing concrete tiles. Lower is more taxing on construction robots! (1-20, Default: 10, 1 will use all available robots)
ignore placed tiles=Ignore already built tiles and replace with refined concrete.
alternate pavement=Internal name of custom pavement type for placement. If not found, reverts to "refined-concrete" as a default.
debug mode=Enable debug mode. Will show data to the console log every creep tick.
tick count=Set the tick interval on which concreep will try to place new ghost entities. (600-18,000, Default: 1,800, one tick is one update, therefore 60 ticks is usually one second)
